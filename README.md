# FaceMaskDetection
🛡️ Face Mask Detection using CNN
📌 Overview

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not. The model is trained on an image dataset of people with masks and without masks, and can be used for real-time detection with webcam or static image inputs.

🚀 Features

Deep Learning model built with CNN.

Classifies images into two categories:

😷 With Mask

🙅 Without Mask

Can be integrated into real-time webcam feed using OpenCV.

Achieves good accuracy on validation/testing dataset.
